# Deploying this Next.js app on Netlify

1. Connect the repo to Netlify (New site from Git).
2. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - (Base directory: leave empty â€“ app is at repository root)
   - Environment variable: `NODE_VERSION = 20`
3. Netlify will detect `netlify.toml` and use `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` to handle SSR/ISR, routing and images.

> Note: Next.js does **not** use a static `index.html` at project root. The HTML is generated by the framework when building/serving.
